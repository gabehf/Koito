description: How to relay listens submitted to Koito to another ListenBrainz compatible server.
---

To use the ListenBrainz API, you need to get your generated api key from the UI.

First, open the settings in your Koito instance by clicking on the settings icon or pressing `\`.

Then, you can navigate to the account tab and log in using the default credentials `admin` and `changeme`, or
the credentials you supplied when first running Koito using the `KOITO_DEFAULT_USERNAME` and `KOITO_DEFAULT_PASSWORD` environment variables.

:::caution
Be sure to change the username and password after logging in for the first time if you used the defaults.
:::

After logging in, open the settings menu again and find the `API Keys` tab. On this tab, you will find the automatically generated API key.

:::note
If you are not running Koito on an `https://` connection or `localhost`,  the click-to-copy button will not work. Instead, just click on the key itself to highlight and copy it.
:::

Then, direct any application you want to scrobble data from to `{your_koito_address}/apis/listenbrainz/1` and provide the api key from the UI as the token.
:::note
For MultiScrobbler, set the endpoint to `{your_koito_address}/apis/listenbrainz/1`

## Set up a relay

Koito allows you to relay listens submitted via the ListenBrainz-compatible API to another ListenBrainz-compatible server.
In order to use this feature, all you need to do is set the `KOITO_ENABLE_LBZ_RELAY`, `KOITO_LBZ_RELAY_URL`, and `KOITO_LBZ_RELAY_TOKEN` variables in your environment.
After setting these variables, be sure to restart your Koito instance to apply the settings.

Once the relay is configured, Koito will automatically forward any requests it recieves on `/apis/listenbrainz/1` to the URL provided in the configuration.

:::note
Be sure to include the full path to the ListenBrainz endpoint of the server you are relaying to in the `KOITO_LBZ_RELAY_URL`.
